   git clone https://github.com/kelvinnambale/Network-projects
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Network-projects
   ```

3. **Open Files in Cisco Packet Tracer**:
   - Launch Cisco Packet Tracer.
   - Open the `.pkt` files by navigating to the downloaded folder.

## Usage

- Open each configuration file in Cisco Packet Tracer to view settings and configurations.
